## Movie Recommender System

This is a content-based hollywood movie recommendation system built using Python. Natural Language Processing was used to recommend the top 10 movies when provided a movie name by the user. 
I have used the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset for building this system.

I used Flask web framework in built in Python to put in on web.
